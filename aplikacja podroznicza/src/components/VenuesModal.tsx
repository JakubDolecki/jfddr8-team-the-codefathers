            Pico do Arieiro is the 3rd highest peak in Madeira at 1,818m above
            sea level, and Pico Ruivo is a whopping 1,862m high and is the
            highest peak on the island. This hike offers insane views of
            Madeiraâ€™s beautiful mountains and rocky volcanic landscape along the
            whole trail.
